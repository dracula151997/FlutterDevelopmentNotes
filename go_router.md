### Difference between `go` and `push` methods in `go_router` package
In the context of Flutter and the `go_router` package, `context.go` and `context.push` are methods used for navigation between different routes in your application.

`context.go` is used to navigate to a new route and replace the current route in the navigation stack. This means that if you navigate to a new route using `context.go`, and then press the back button, you will not return to the previous route. Instead, you will exit the application or go back to whatever route was before the previous one in the navigation stack.

Here's an example of how to use `context.go`:

```dart
context.go('/new_route');
```

On the other hand, `context.push` is used to navigate to a new route and add it on top of the current route in the navigation stack. This means that if you navigate to a new route using `context.push`, and then press the back button, you will return to the previous route.

Here's an example of how to use `context.push`:

```dart
context.push('/new_route');
```

In summary, the main difference between `context.go` and `context.push` is how they handle the navigation stack. `context.go` replaces the current route, while `context.push` adds the new route on top of the current one.

### `NavigatorObserver` in go_router package
To implement `NavigatorObserver` in `go_router`, you need to create a class that extends `NavigatorObserver` and override its methods. You've already done this with your `GoRouterObserver` class.

The `GoRouter` package provides a `GoRouter` class that you can use to configure your routes and handle navigation. You can pass an instance of your `GoRouterObserver` to the `GoRouter` constructor to observe navigation events.

Here's an example of how to do this:

```dart
final goRouter = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      pageBuilder: (context, state) => MaterialPage<void>(
        key: state.pageKey,
        child: HomePage(),
      ),
    ),
    // Add more routes here
  ],
  observers: [GoRouterObserver()],
);
```

In this example, `GoRouterObserver()` is an instance of your `GoRouterObserver` class. The `observers` parameter of the `GoRouter` constructor takes a list of `NavigatorObserver` objects. These observers are notified whenever the `GoRouter` navigates to a new route.

Now, whenever the `GoRouter` navigates to a new route, your `GoRouterObserver` will print the name of the route to the console. You can replace the `debugPrint` calls in your `GoRouterObserver` methods with your own logic to handle navigation events as needed.

-------------
### `NavigatorObserver` methods in go_router package
The `NavigatorObserver` class in Flutter has several methods that can be overridden to listen to navigation events. Here are the methods:

- `didPush`: Called when the Navigator has pushed a new route.

- `didPop`: Called when the Navigator has popped the current route.

- `didRemove`: Called when the Navigator has removed a route.

- `didReplace`: Called when the Navigator has replaced the old route with a new route.

- `didStartUserGesture`: Called when the Navigator's user gesture to pop or push a route has started.

- `didStopUserGesture`: Called when the Navigator's user gesture to pop or push a route has stopped.

- `navigator`: A getter that returns the NavigatorState of the Navigator that this observer is observing.

Here's an example of how these methods can be overridden:

```dart
class MyNavigatorObserver extends NavigatorObserver {
  @override
  void didPush(Route route, Route? previousRoute) {
    // Handle route push
  }

  @override
  void didPop(Route route, Route? previousRoute) {
    // Handle route pop
  }

  @override
  void didRemove(Route route, Route? previousRoute) {
    // Handle route removal
  }

  @override
  void didReplace({Route? newRoute, Route? oldRoute}) {
    // Handle route replacement
  }

  @override
  void didStartUserGesture(Route route, Route? previousRoute) {
    // Handle start of user gesture
  }

  @override
  void didStopUserGesture() {
    // Handle stop of user gesture
  }

  @override
  NavigatorState? get navigator {
    // Return the NavigatorState
    return super.navigator;
  }
}
```

In this example, each method is overridden and includes a comment where you can add your own logic to handle each navigation event.
